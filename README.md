# **Net-News**
The Android app delivers the latest news articles to users by fetching data from a remote server via an API in JSON format. It offers a personalized experience by allowing users to search for news articles on various topics, view their search and browsing history, and bookmark their favorite articles for later reading.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Fetching News via API:**
   - The app is integrated with a news API that serves articles in a structured JSON format.
   - It fetches real-time news updates across different categories (like politics, technology, sports, etc.).
   - The data includes the article title, description, image, source, and publication date.

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Users can search for specific topics or keywords, such as "climate change" or "latest tech trends."
   - The app displays relevant news articles based on the search input.
   - Search results are dynamically fetched from the server to ensure up-to-date information.

3. **History Tracking:**
   - The app keeps track of articles the user has previously viewed.
   - A "History" section shows the user a list of articles theyâ€™ve interacted with, making it easy to revisit previous news items.
   - The history is saved locally on the device, possibly using Room or Shared Preferences for storage.

4. **Bookmarking Articles:**
   - Users can save articles for later reading by bookmarking them.
   - A "Bookmark" section allows them to view all their saved articles in one place.
   - Bookmarks are stored locally on the device using a persistent storage solution like Room Database or Firebase (in case cloud syncing is needed).

5. **User Interface:**
   - The app offers a clean and intuitive UI, featuring a homepage with the latest trending articles and a search bar at the top.
   - News categories (like World, Business, Sports) are available for users to explore via tabs or a ViewPager.
   - A bottom navigation bar allows easy access to key features like Home, Search, History, and Bookmarks.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - The app handles errors gracefully, such as when the API call fails or the network is down.
   - Users are informed with friendly error messages like "Unable to load news. Please check your connection."

7. **User Authentication (Optional):**
   - If Firebase authentication is used, users can create accounts to save their bookmarks and history to the cloud.
   - This enables multi-device support and personalized news feeds.

The app, through its news retrieval system and personalization features like search, history, and bookmarks, provides a comprehensive and user-friendly way for users to stay updated with the latest news articles.
